Absolutely! Let me explain **how your Java RMI-based Cab Booking System works from start to finish** in a clear and complete way, step-by-step, including all the components, how they interact, and how the RMI mechanism works under the hood.

---

# üöñ Full Explanation of the Java RMI Cab Booking System

---

## 1. **Project Components**

Your system consists mainly of these parts:

### a. **Server Side**

* **DBConnection.java**
  Manages database connection (MySQL) using JDBC.

* **CabBookingInterface.java**
  Defines the remote methods clients can call via RMI.

* **CabBookingImpl.java**
  Implements the remote interface, contains the business logic and executes SQL queries on the DB.

* **ServerMain.java**
  Sets up the RMI server, registers the remote object with the RMI registry so clients can find it.

* **TestDB.java** (optional)
  Used to test if the database connection is working properly.

---

### b. **Client Side**

* **CabBookingClient.java**
  Command-line interface client that calls remote methods.

* **CabBookingGUI.java**
  GUI client (Java Swing or JavaFX) for user-friendly interaction.

---

### c. **Supporting files**

* **mysql-connector-j-8.0.33.jar** ‚Äî MySQL JDBC driver.

* **schema.sql** ‚Äî SQL script to create database schema and tables.

* **server.policy** ‚Äî Java security policy file for RMI.

* **run\_cab\_book.sh** ‚Äî Shell script to compile and run the system.

* **setcp.sh** ‚Äî Utility shell script to set classpath (optional).

* **.gitignore** ‚Äî Ignore rules for git.

---

## 2. **How Java RMI Works in Your System**

Java RMI allows your client program to call methods on a remote Java object as if it were local.

* **RMI Registry** is a special service that runs on a port (2001 here).
  It acts like a phone book that maps **names** to remote objects.

* **Server** creates an instance of the remote object (`CabBookingImpl`) and **binds it** to the registry under a name like `"CabService"`.

* **Client** looks up `"CabService"` in the registry to get a **stub** (proxy) object.

* When client calls a method on the stub, the call is sent **over the network** to the actual remote object on the server.

---

## 3. **Detailed Flow When Client Makes a Request**

Let's walk through the entire flow for a request, e.g., **‚ÄúShow available cabs in Gachibowli‚Äù**

---

### Step 1: **Start RMI Registry**

* You run:

  ```bash
  rmiregistry 2001
  ```
* This starts the registry on port 2001, ready to accept remote object registrations.

---

### Step 2: **Start Server**

* The server program runs:

  ```bash
  java -cp .:lib/mysql-connector-j-8.0.33.jar -Djava.security.policy=server.policy Server.ServerMain
  ```
* `ServerMain`:

  * Creates an instance of `CabBookingImpl` (the remote object).
  * Registers this object with the RMI registry on port 2001 under the name `"CabService"`:

    ```java
    Naming.rebind("rmi://localhost:2001/CabService", new CabBookingImpl());
    ```
  * Now the remote object is ready and waiting for client calls.

---

### Step 3: **Client Looks Up Remote Object**

* The client starts and executes:

  ```java
  CabBookingInterface cabService = 
      (CabBookingInterface) Naming.lookup("rmi://localhost:2001/CabService");
  ```
* This asks the RMI registry:
  ‚ÄúWhere can I find the object named `CabService`?‚Äù
* Registry returns a **stub**, which acts like a proxy for the real object on the server.

---

### Step 4: **Client Calls Remote Method**

* When the client calls:

  ```java
  List<String> cabs = cabService.viewAvailableCabs("Gachibowli");
  ```
* The stub intercepts this call, packages method name and parameters, sends them over the network to the server.

---

### Step 5: **Server Executes the Method**

* The server‚Äôs `CabBookingImpl.viewAvailableCabs("Gachibowli")` runs:

  * Uses `DBConnection` to open a connection to MySQL.
  * Runs SQL query:

    ```sql
    SELECT cab_id, driver_name FROM available_cabs_view WHERE location = 'Gachibowli';
    ```
  * Fetches results from DB.
  * Constructs a `List<String>` of cab details.
  * Returns this list.

---

### Step 6: **RMI Sends Back the Response**

* The server serializes the `List<String>` result.
* Sends it back through the network to the client stub.

---

### Step 7: **Client Receives Result and Displays**

* The client stub deserializes the list.
* The client program continues, e.g., displays the cabs on console or GUI.

---

## 4. **Other Example Actions**

* **Booking a cab:**
  Client calls `cabService.bookCab(username, location)`.
  Server inserts booking in DB and returns confirmation.

* **Viewing booking history:**
  Client calls `cabService.getBookingHistory(username)`.
  Server queries DB and returns booking data.

---

## 5. **Security and Classpath**

* The **`server.policy`** grants permissions required by RMI to allow networking and class loading.

* Classpath (`-cp`) includes the JDBC driver and your compiled classes for server and client.

                                                    +--------------+
                                                    | MySQL DB     |
                                                    +--------------+

Result flows back the same way.
